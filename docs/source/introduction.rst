Introduction
============

To get started with using Python to analyze geospatial data and plan the perfect route to your destination, this documentation provides a step-by-step guide to the process. With increasing traffic and environmental concerns, cycling and walking have become a popular mode of transportation, and finding the most efficient and enjoyable route can be a challenge. By using geospatial data and Python, you can easily find the best bike route to your office building or any other destination.

The "Introduction" page of this documentation provides an overview of the project and explains the key concepts involved. This includes an explanation of how to use geospatial data to plan a route and how to use Python to analyze this data. The page also provides an overview of the specific tools and packages used in the project.

The "Examples" page provides practical examples and code snippets that can be used to implement the techniques outlined in the documentation. These examples cover a range of topics, including loading and manipulating geospatial data, calculating the best route using OSMnx, and analyzing building data along the route. Each example is accompanied by detailed explanations and code that can be easily adapted to suit your specific needs.
